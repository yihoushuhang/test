 I miss the days to the sweet lie
 I miss the conversation
 I'm such a fool of song tonight
 I'm changing of all the stations
 I like to think did we had it all
 We drove 'em out to the better days
 But I'm not running I'm super fun
 Oh baby why did you run away
 I was there for you
 In you darkest times
 I was there for you
 In your darkest nights
 But I wonder where were you
 When I was at my worst
 Down on my knees
 And instead of my having back
 So I wonder where were you
 All the worse you took came back to me
 So I'm following the map that leads to you
 The map that leads to you
 And nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following to you
 The map that leads to you
 And nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following
 I hear your voice at my sleeping night
 Hard to resist temptation
 Cause all the strangers come over me
 Now I can't get over you
 No I just can't get over you
 I was there for you
 In you darkest times
 I was there for you
 In your darkest nights
 But I wonder where were you
 When I was at my worst
 Down on my knees
 And instead of my having back
 So I wonder where were you
 All the worse you took came back to me
 So I'm following the map that leads to you
 The map that leads to you
 And nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following to you
 The map that leads to you
 And nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Oh oh oh
 Oh oh oh
 Yeah yeah yeah
 Oh oh oh
 Oh oh
 Oh I was there for you
 Oh In you darkest times
 Oh I was there for you
 Oh In your darkest nights
 Oh I was there for you
 Oh In you darkest times
 Oh I was there for you
 Oh In your darkest nights
 But I wonder where were you
 When I was at my worst
 Down on my knees
 And instead of my having back
 So I wonder where were you
 All the worse you took came back to me
 So I'm following the map that leads to you
 The map that leads to you
 And nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following to you
 The map that leads to you
 And nothing I can do
 The map that leads to you
 Following, following, following
